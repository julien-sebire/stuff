# BÉPO (French Dvorak) keyboard layout

It seems that the host for the Bépo installation package for Windows is down, so you can find the full version [here](bepo-1.1rc2-full-azerty.exe) (fortunately I saved it from a previous install, but unfortunately I only have the full package without original shortcuts).
